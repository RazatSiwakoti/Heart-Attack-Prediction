# HeartAttackPrediction

## Overview
This repository houses a machine-learning project focused on predicting heart attacks. The project utilizes Logistic Regression and explores a dataset containing crucial factors related to heart health. The model is trained to provide insights into the likelihood of a heart attack based on diverse features.

## Contents
1. **Code:** The main Python script (`heart_attack_prediction.py`) contains the entire pipeline, including data loading, preprocessing, visualization, model training, and evaluation.

2. **Data:** The dataset (`heart.csv`) is used for training and testing the model. Ensure the dataset is stored in the same directory before running the script.

3. **Visualizations:** The `visualizations` folder contains plots illustrating the distribution of the target variable and other relevant relationships within the dataset.

4. **Requirements:** The `requirements.txt` file lists the necessary Python packages to run the code successfully. Install dependencies using:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
